Here are some advantages of using the "diagram as code" approach:

- **Version Control**: Allows tracking changes over time and easy collaboration among team members.
- **Automation**: Diagrams can be generated automatically from the code, reducing manual effort and ensuring accuracy.
- **Consistency**: By defining styles and components in the code, you can ensure consistency across all diagrams.
- **Portability**: As the diagrams are in code form, they can be easily shared and used across different platforms

Always provide a link to the sources and use a tool like [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/) or
[Mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/).
