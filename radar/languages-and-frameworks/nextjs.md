Next.js is an open-source React front-end development web framework that enables functionality such as server-side rendering and generating static websites for React based web applications. It is a production-ready framework that allows developers to quickly create static and dynamic JAMstack websites.

Use Next.js for any web project that needs server-side rendering, static generation, and/or file-system routing. It is especially useful for large applications that need to be built quickly or maintained by multiple developers like backoffice applications.
