### Key Features

- **Great community support**: the large community behind spring boot and Pivotal itself allow for ready-to-use integrations for most commonly used technologies.

- **Production ready**: provide production-ready features such as metrics, health checks, and externalized configuration

- **Fast bootstrapping**: a lot of 'starter' dependencies to simplify your build configuration and make service ready to run

### Our use cases
- [File Reporter](https://github.com/pagopa/rtd-ms-file-reporter): microservice responsible to provide an aggregated view of a file processing system. Thanks to Spring Boot and it's 'starter' dependencies the microservice expose a REST interface and integrate a kafka consumer in a simple and configurable way.

A lot of others microservice are using Spring Boot in production.
